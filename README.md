# Notes

## Object
Using Vue, Vue Router and the Firestore DB, create a Notes Web App to store and manage notes. 

## The db.js File
The `db.js` file is purposely missing from this repository as it contains the Firestore App credentials. To use this application, create a Firestore database and Web App. Then use the Web App's credentials to create a `db.js` file.
